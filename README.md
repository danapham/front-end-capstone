# Gredients

## Description
Gredients is a mobile-friendly web application that allows users to build grocery lists on the fly. Users can select recipes that they plan to cook and the app generates a list of ingredients sorted by their typical location in a grocery store. If multiple recipes call for the same ingredient in various quantities, the app will calculate the total quantity required for those recipes. The app will have user authentication and CRUD for recipe ingredients and ingredients on the shopping list.
